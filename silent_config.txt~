# This is a sample silent configuration response file

# To configure an agent using this silent response file:
#   1) copy this file to another location and modify the necessary parameters
#   2) run "CandleConfig -A -p <silent_response_file> <pc>"
#      - give an absolute path for the silent_response_file
#      - pc is the two character product code of the agent to be configured

# Syntax rules:
# - Comment lines begin with "#"
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Parameter lines are PARAMETER=value (do not put space before the PARAMETER)
# - Space before or after an equal sign is OK
# - Parameter values should NOT contain the following characters $, =, or |
