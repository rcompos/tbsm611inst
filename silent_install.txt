# The product codes of the products to be installed.
# This parameter can be given once for each product to install or
# specifying 'all' will install all products for the given platform.
# NOTE: Some products are not supported on some platforms.  Use the
#       command line installer to determine what products are available
#       on the platform.

# If installing the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (INSTALL_PRODUCT=ms), 
# provide a name for the server.  
# If upgrading the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (INSTALL_PRODUCT=ms), 
# an installed server name should be provided. If a new server name is provided
# for upgrade, a new server will be created, rather than upgrading any installed
# server.
# This serves as a label to identify the server and should not be an IP
# address or hostname.

# NEW - This option adds the default managed system groups to all applicable situations from the product support packages 
# that are being seeded for the first time. Note that not all situations have the default managed group setting. 
# For some, you might need to manually define the distribution in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal due to the specific content of the agent support package. 
# Modifications are not made to managed system groups in upgraded product support packages.
# ALL - This option adds the default managed system groups to all the applicable situations. Note that not all situations have 
# the default managed group setting. For some, you might need to manually define the distribution in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal 
# due to the specific content of the agent support package.
# NONE - The default managed system group is not added to any situation.
# When no value provided default (NEW) will be selected as default.
